Audio Textbooks

Audileo is a leading provider of free and paid audio textbooks. As an official OpenStax technology partner, Audileo is converting their popular textbooks into engaging audiobooks. By using text-to-speech (TTS) technology, Audileo brings academic text to audio. This gives learners a hands-free, flexible way to interact with their readings, whether on the go, during commutes, or as a supplement to traditional study methods. 

Why Audileo?  
Accessibility: Audileo supports students with learning differences like ADHD, dyslexia, and visual impairments by providing audio versions of textbooks. This caters to various study needs and opens opportunities for those who find print challenging or prefer other formats.

Flexibility: With Audileo, students can consume course material anytime, anywhere. This makes it easier for them to fit learning into busy schedules filled with classes, jobs, and activities.

Comprehension: Audio learning can strengthen understanding. It offers a multisensory study option that helps many students retain information better. For some, hearing complicated subjects read aloud clarifies difficult concepts.

Efficiency: You can listen at different speeds, repeat important sections, or use audio in a study group or revision session. Audileo fits into any learning situation, helping students increase productivity.

How Audileo Works  
It converts college-level textbooks, such as those from OpenStax, into clear, high-quality audio textbooks.

Audileo is designed specifically for educational materials, focusing on proper pronunciation, pacing, and logical structuring for smooth listening. All audiobooks are proofread to ensure high quality, outperforming online TTS readers.

It provides chapter-level navigation, allowing students to jump directly to the topics or sections they need for their coursework or revision.
